# CLAUDE.md — PERM Tracker v2

> **Stack:** Next.js 16.2.9 + Convex 1.42.3 + React 19.2.7 + TypeScript (strict)
> **Status:** Production | **Last Updated:** 2026-05-24

**Convex rules:** read [`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md`](convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md) before writing Convex code.
**Codebase deep-dives:** [`.planning/codebase/`](../.planning/codebase/) — STACK, INTEGRATIONS, ARCHITECTURE, STRUCTURE, CONVENTIONS, TESTING, CONCERNS.
**API reference:** [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md). **PERM flow:** [`../perm_flow.md`](../perm_flow.md).
**Docs (`docs/`):** [API](docs/API.md) · [DESIGN_SYSTEM](docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) · [ANIMATION_STORYBOARD](docs/ANIMATION_STORYBOARD.md) · [CRYPTO](docs/CRYPTO.md) · [compliance/](docs/compliance/) (SOC 2 evidence). Feature behaviour lives in the code + codebase deep-dives, not standalone docs.

## Central PERM Business Logic

**ALL PERM logic lives in ONE place** — NEVER recreate deadline/validation/cascade logic elsewhere.

```
convex/lib/perm/     ← canonical source
src/lib/perm/        ← frontend re-exports
```

```typescript
// Frontend
import { calculatePWDExpiration, validateCase, applyCascade } from '@/lib/perm';
// Convex functions
import { calculatePWDExpiration, validateCase, applyCascade } from '../lib/perm';
```

Structure: `calculators/` · `validators/` · `dates/` · `deadlines/` · `recruitment/` · `cascade.ts` · `statusCalculation.ts` · `constants.ts`. See [STRUCTURE.md](../.planning/codebase/STRUCTURE.md).

### Common usage

```typescript
// Form cascade
setFormData(applyCascade(formData, { field, value }));

// Validation
const result = validateCase(formData);
if (!result.valid) { setErrors(result.errors); return; }

// Filing window
const status = getFilingWindowStatusFromCase(caseData);
```

---

## Convex Patterns

| Type | Use | Import |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | Read | `from './_generated/server'` |
| `mutation` | Write | `from './_generated/server'` |
| `action` | Side effects, external APIs | `from './_generated/server'` |

`internalQuery`/`internalMutation`/`internalAction` for server-only, called via `internal.*`.

**Auth:** `getCurrentUserId(ctx)` (throws) or `getCurrentUserIdOrNull(ctx)` from `./lib/auth`.

**Auth callbacks gotcha:** `createOrUpdateUser` in `convex/auth.ts` is NOT called for password sign-ins of existing users. Login tracking is client-side via `LoginTracker` (`src/components/auth/LoginTracker.tsx`, localStorage + 30s debounce). `afterUserCreatedOrUpdated` is never used.

**Schema changes:** edit `convex/schema.ts` — `npx convex dev` auto-applies. Index naming: `by_fieldName` or `by_field1_field2`.

---

## Date Protocol

**ALL dates are ISO strings (YYYY-MM-DD).** Never store `Date` objects.

```typescript
import { parseISO, format, addDays } from 'date-fns';
const result = format(addDays(parseISO('2024-06-15'), 30), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

```typescript
// DON'T: Recreate deadline logic
const expiration = addDays(determinationDate, 365); // WRONG
// DO: import { calculatePWDExpiration } from '@/lib/perm';

// DON'T: Hardcode validation rules
if (filingDate > certDate + 180) { ... } // WRONG
// DO: import { validateI140 } from '@/lib/perm';

// DON'T: Manual business day calculation
// DO: import { addBusinessDays } from '@/lib/perm';

// DON'T: Use ?? in dense expressions (SWC minifier drops vars with ~20+ ?? chains → prod ReferenceError)
const value = a ?? b ?? c ?? d ?? e; // WRONG
// DO: Use || or ternary
const value = a || b || c || d || e;

// DON'T: Store Date objects in Convex
await ctx.db.patch(id, { pwdFilingDate: new Date() }); // WRONG
// DO: ISO strings
await ctx.db.patch(id, { pwdFilingDate: format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd") });

// DON'T: trust a truthiness check as a change detector
...(row.pendingField ? { notifiedAt: undefined } : {})   // WRONG: always set
// DO: compare against the current value
const changed = row.pendingField !== undefined && row.pendingField !== row.field;

// DON'T: write an unanchored regex to read a value out of a cell
/([A-Za-z]+)\s+(\d{4})/   // WRONG: "As of May 2025 ... September 2025" -> 2025-05
// DO: anchor it. A plausible WRONG value is worse than a null, because null is
// visible downstream and a wrong date is not.
/^([A-Za-z]+)\.?,?\s+(\d{4})$/

// DON'T: Import toast from sonner directly (not auth-aware, fires during sign-out)
import { toast } from "sonner"; // WRONG
// DO:
import { toast } from "@/lib/toast";

// DON'T: Put client init (posthog.init, etc.) in a ROOT instrumentation-client.ts
// With a src/ app dir, Next.js loads ONLY src/instrumentation-client.ts — root is ignored → silent outage
// DO: keep posthog.init() + initBotId() together in src/instrumentation-client.ts  // see CONCERNS TD-06
```

## Two typecheckers, and passing one proves nothing about the other

`pnpm typecheck` now runs both. It did not always, and that is how a broken
`convex/` file shipped past a green local run.

| | `tsconfig.json` (app) | `convex/tsconfig.json` |
|---|---|---|
| `lib` | `dom, dom.iterable, esnext` | **`ES2021, dom`** |
| test files | **excluded** (`**/*.test.ts`) | **included** (`./**/*`) |

Two independent gaps, either one sufficient. `Array.prototype.at` is ES2022, so
`results.at(-1)` compiles under the app config and fails under Convex's. And
because the app config excludes tests, `pnpm typecheck:app` never even opened
the file. The Convex plugin's end-of-turn hook caught it only because it runs
`convex codegen`, which typechecks with Convex's config.

**Anything under `convex/` must satisfy both.** Use `pnpm typecheck`.
`tsc -p convex --noEmit` is the pure check — `convex codegen` also uploads to
the deployment, so it is not a typecheck substitute.

---

## Sending email

**Resend does NOT throw on failure.** Verified in `resend@6.22.0`
(`dist/index.mjs`): `fetchRequest` returns `{ data: null, error }` for a 429, a
422 and a network failure alike. A bare `try { await resend.emails.send(...) }`
has a catch block that is **dead code for every realistic failure**, and any
line after the send runs as if it succeeded.

```typescript
// DON'T: the catch never fires, and the subscriber gets marked as mailed
try {
  await getResend().emails.send({ ... });
  await ctx.runMutation(internal.x.markNotified, { id });   // runs on a 429
} catch (e) { /* unreachable */ }

// DO: sendEmailWithRetry handles both shapes AND enforces the blocklist
const result = await sendEmailWithRetry(getResend(), { ... });
if (result.error) { /* log, recordError, do NOT advance state */ }
```

`sendEmailWithRetry` (`convex/lib/email.ts`) is the only sanctioned path. It
checks the returned `error`, catches genuinely-thrown network errors, retries
rate limits with backoff, and enforces `isEmailBlocklisted`. Calling the SDK
directly walks around all four — and makes `convex/lib/emailBlocklist.ts`'s
stated invariant ("no code path can send to it") false.

**The Resend account cap is 100/day and is SHARED** with password resets, OTP
and deadline reminders. Exhausting it has caused a real outage. Any new sending
path needs a budget, not just good intentions.

---

## Public unauthenticated endpoints

`convex/http.ts` carries routes any stranger can hit. Checklist, each item
learned from a real defect in `convex/queueAlerts.ts`:

- **The mutation behind the route is `internalMutation`, never `mutation`.** A
  public mutation is a second entry point that skips the HTTP layer's field
  narrowing, its length caps and its rate limit, and makes the CORS allowlist
  decorative (CORS is browser-side only; the Convex API is callable directly).
- **A per-identity limit cannot stop identity rotation.** A per-address cooldown
  does nothing against an attacker cycling fresh addresses; a per-IP limit does
  nothing against a proxy pool. **Add a global budget on the shared finite
  resource itself** — that is the only limit that cannot be rotated around.
- **Order your guards by cost.** Cheap shape checks first. Put the length cap
  *before* any regex that can backtrack: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]{2,}$/`
  measured **8.2 s** on an 80k-character input in V8, and 0.005 ms with the
  length check first. `v.string()` accepts ~1 MB.
- **GET must not mutate.** Outlook Safe Links, Mimecast, Proofpoint and
  Barracuda all fetch URLs in inbound mail, so a GET that acts lets a
  recipient's own mail gateway click their links. Render a POST button instead.
- **Distinguish 400 from 429** in the response, or every typo reads as
  rate-limiting in monitoring.

---

## Action tokens (`convex/lib/unsubscribeToken.ts`)

`makeUnsubscribeToken(email, secret, purpose?)` signs `<purpose>:<email>`.
**Always pass a purpose for new callers.** Without one, every token for an
address is the same string, so a link meaning "unsubscribe me" is byte-identical
to one meaning "confirm me" and differs only in which path it is pasted into —
which let an unsubscribe link be replayed against a confirm route to undo an
opt-out.

The bare form is kept **only** for weekly-digest links already sitting in real
inboxes (`convex/notificationActions.ts`). Those have no expiry; making scoping
mandatory would silently break every one of them.

These tokens never expire and are replayable by anyone who can read the email.
Fine for "stop sending me mail" (idempotent, self-harming at worst). **Never
treat one as a fresh act of consent** — anything that grants or restores a
subscription must re-check state, not trust the signature.

---

## Convex gotchas beyond the generated guidelines

- **`ctx.scheduler.runAfter` discards the return value.** A function that
  returns `{ sent, remaining }` to a scheduler resumes nothing. If work is
  batched, it must **reschedule itself**; guard that on having made progress so
  a total outage cannot spin a timer.
- **Index field order is the difference between a bounded read and a table
  scan.** Lead with the equality predicates that mean "is this row still live",
  and put the range field last (Convex allows a range comparison only on the
  final indexed field). `.collect()` then filtering in JS re-reads every row you
  already dealt with, forever, and fails hard at the read limit rather than
  degrading. Iterate the query with an early `break` when a JS-side predicate
  remains.
- **`.extend()` / `.fields` bind validators to each other, NOT to the table.**
  The table body in `schema.ts` is derived from nothing, and TypeScript does not
  excess-property-check a spread of a non-fresh variable, so an *extra*
  validator field typechecks green and fails at runtime. Assert exactness:
  ```typescript
  type Ok = Doc<"t"> extends Infer<typeof val>
    ? Infer<typeof val> extends Doc<"t"> ? true : never : never;
  const _ok: Ok = true; void _ok;
  ```
  Probe it by adding a phantom field and confirming it goes red.
- **Patching a field to `undefined` DELETES it**, and `JSON.stringify` hides
  that: `{...(x ? {f: undefined} : {})}` prints as `{}`. Check `"f" in patch`.

---

## Code Style

- **TypeScript strict** — no `any`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` enabled
- **ISO date strings** everywhere
- **Central imports** — `@/lib/perm` or `convex/lib/perm`
- **TDD** — tests first for business logic
- **Named exports** preferred (default only for page components)
- **Import order** — framework → third-party → `@/` → relative → types
- **Soft deletes** — filter `q.eq(q.field("deletedAt"), undefined)`
- **Errors** — frontend: `handleOperationError()` from `@/lib/errors`; backend: `recordError()` from `convex/lib/errorRecording`

Full conventions: [CONVENTIONS.md](../.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md).

---

## Integrations (quick reference — details in INTEGRATIONS.md)

- **Sentry** — lazy-loaded client (`SentryClientInit`). Frontend: `captureError` from `@/lib/sentry`. Backend: `recordError` from `convex/lib/errorRecording` (writes DB + admin email + Sentry in one call).
- **PostHog** — always import `@/lib/analytics` (wrapper with try/catch), never raw `posthog-js`. Client init (`posthog.init`) lives in `src/instrumentation-client.ts` **alongside BotID** — Next.js loads only that ONE file (a root `instrumentation-client.ts` is silently ignored), so splitting them kills one. Proxied via `/ingest/*` (incl. `/ingest/array` for lazy bundles). Internal opt-out: `POSTHOG_EXCLUDED_EMAILS` Convex env var. See [CONCERNS.md TD-06](../.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md).
- **Resend Email** — transactional via Resend MCP tools (list/send/contacts), `curl` for threaded replies (needs `In-Reply-To` header which MCP doesn't expose), or `admin.sendAdminEmail` mutation for UI sends (auth-required, auto-renders `AdminEmail` React template). `FROM_EMAIL = notifications@permtracker.app`.
- **AI Chat** — multi-provider fallback (Groq→Mistral→Gemini→OpenRouter→Cerebras) via custom `FallbackModel` in `src/lib/ai/providers.ts`. API route: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`.

## Content Hub (MDX)

Content in `content/{blog,tutorials,guides,changelog,resources}/*.mdx`. Processed by `next-mdx-remote` + `gray-matter` + `reading-time`. MDX components registered in `src/lib/content/mdx-components.tsx`: `Callout`, `ProductCTA`, `StepByStep`/`Step`, `ComparisonTable`, `ScreenshotFigure`, `VideoFigure`, `VideoPlayer`.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Date off by one day | Use UTC functions |
| Validation not catching error | Check you're using the right validator |
| Cascade not triggering | Ensure `applyCascade()` called on change |
| Import not found | `@/lib/perm` (frontend) vs `convex/lib/perm` (backend) |
| `ReferenceError: _ref is not defined` (prod only) | SWC minifier bug — replace `??` with `\|\|`. See [CONCERNS.md TD-01](../.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md) |
| `X is not defined` (prod build) | Check SWC minifier, `optimizePackageImports`, `concatenateModules`, React Compiler |
| Auth callback not firing | `createOrUpdateUser` skips password sign-ins — use `LoginTracker` |
| Toast during sign-out | Import `@/lib/toast`, not `sonner` |
| PostHog/analytics silently not capturing | Client init must be in `src/instrumentation-client.ts` (the only one Next.js loads; a root one is ignored) — PostHog + BotID coexist there. [CONCERNS.md TD-06](../.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md) |
| Convex action can't call another action | `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, ...)` instead |
| Sitemap dates stale | Update `lastModified` in `src/app/sitemap.ts` |
| Typecheck green locally, Convex plugin hook fails | You ran `typecheck:app` only. `pnpm typecheck` runs both — see "Two typecheckers" |
| Email "sent" but never arrived, nothing logged | A bare `resend.emails.send()`. Resend returns `{error}`, it does not throw. Use `sendEmailWithRetry` |
| A sweep only ever processes one batch | `scheduler.runAfter` discards return values; the function must reschedule itself |
