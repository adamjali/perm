## GSD Workflow

Uses GSD (`~/gsd-adam`). Config: quality profile, all gates ON, auto_advance OFF, branching none.
v1.0 (10 phases) + v2.0 (22 phases) shipped. Post-v2 features ongoing.
Key: `/gsd:feature`, `/gsd:quick`, `/gsd:map-codebase`, `/gsd:help`

---

## Deployment

Push to main triggers auto-deploy:
- **Vercel:** Frontend rebuild
- **Convex:** `npx convex deploy -y` (manual, from `v2/`)

### Project Names (avoid confusion)

| Service | Name | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| GitHub repo | `perm` | See remote origin |
| Local folder | `perm-tracker/v2/` | All code lives in `v2/` |
| Vercel project | `perm` | Deploys from `v2/`, hosts `permtracker.app` |
| Convex prod | See `.env.local` | `npx convex deploy -y` from `v2/` |
| Convex dev | See `.env.local` | `npx convex dev` from `v2/` |

**Always run commands from `v2/` directory.** Claude is always launched from `v2/`. Vercel CLI is linked to project "perm" via `v2/.vercel/project.json`.

## SEO: JSX glues adjacent element text (2026-08-23)

`<A/>` newline `<B/>` in JSX renders with **zero characters between them**, so
`Blog` + `Tutorials` reads as `BlogTutorials` to anything that walks the DOM.
Google's snippet extraction is textContent-shaped and ignores CSS layout — proven
the same day, when it printed the identical defect verbatim in a sibling site's
search listing. permtracker.app had **624 joins across its 11 public pages**; they are
**fixed and gated**. Re-verified live 2026-08-27: 44 pages scanned from the
sitemap, **0 glued pairs**, and the sweep prints a control string so a blind
run cannot read as a pass. Full recipe, scope and verification loop:
[`v2/CLAUDE.md`](v2/CLAUDE.md), section "Glued JSX text".

**The source-level gate is not the authoritative one** - it cannot see
`.map()` output, custom components, `motion.*`, or conditionals. Run
`scripts/audit_glued_text.py` against rendered pages.


## Where the data comes from (2026-08-27: first-party throughout)

Every dataset now has a primary source of record. **Zero live third-party
dependencies.**

| dataset | source | cadence |
|---|---|---|
| per-case status | **DOL** `flag.dol.gov`, batch API | full daily 04:10 ET, pending 15:40 ET |
| decided cases | **DOL** quarterly disclosure files | quarterly + monthly check |
| processing times | **DOL** FLAG | daily |
| visa bulletin | **State Dept** (84 months, 2019-10 →) | monthly, one human minute |
| I-140 counts / I-485 inventory | **USCIS** | quarterly / monthly |
| entities, daily decisions | derived from our own corpus | with each quarterly |
| RFI funnel | permtrack aggregate **frozen**, plus our own observations | frozen half never re-read |

The permtrack mirror survives as a dispatchable fallback with **no schedule**,
because two writers with different notions of truth pointed at one table is a
flip-flop, not redundancy. Detail: [`v2/CLAUDE.md`](v2/CLAUDE.md), sections
"Per-case status comes from DOL directly" and "The RFI funnel is BLENDED".
